Originally, I first had the idea for this app during a math class in my final high school year. I was fascinated by how equation systems could be solved using matrices and logical patterns, and so I started to wonder on how to make this whole process automatic.

After experimenting a bit I finished my first prototype, which was only able to solve systems with exactly 2 equations. At that point, I still had not implemented matrix-solving methods in the app. Roughly one week later, with real matrices implemented, the final project was finished. 


## Features
